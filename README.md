# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world, imbalanced datasets. This project also emphasizes clarity in documentation to make complex models accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.



##  Project Overview

This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud. It provides an end-to-end walkthrough of data exploration, model development, dimensionality reduction, and handling class imbalance, with an added layer of user-friendly documentation throughout the process.

The aim is to not only build a high-performing model but also to document it in a way that anyone can understand and replicate.



## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains **284,807 transactions** with only **492 frauds** (high class imbalance).
- Includes anonymized features `V1` to `V28`, `Time`, `Amount`, and `Class`.



##  Technologies Used

- Languages: Python  
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Techniques: PCA (dimensionality reduction), SMOTE (class balancing), Reinforcement Learning  
- Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
